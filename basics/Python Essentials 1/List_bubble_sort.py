"""
Now that you can effectively juggle the elements of lists, it's time to learn how to sort them.
Many sorting algorithms have been invented so far, which differ a lot in speed, as well as in complexity. 
We are going to show you a very simple algorithm, easy to understand, but unfortunately not too efficient, either.
It's used very rarely, and certainly not for large and extensive lists.
